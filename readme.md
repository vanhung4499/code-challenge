# 99Tech Code Challenge #1

## Overview

This repository contains the solution for the 99Tech Code Challenge #1.

I just apply for backend developer position, so i only do the backend tasks include: problem 4, 5, 6.

Please read the `README.md` in each problem directory for more information.

## Notes

- For problem 5, I use NestJS to build the CRUD API, but I don't know it's allowed or not.
- For problem 6, I write some additional advanced technique, but I don't have time to implement all of them.
- I haven't worked with JS/TS Backend for a year, but I confident with my skills and knowledge. If you have any feedback, please let me know.
