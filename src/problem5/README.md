# Problem 5: Backend Server with Express.js and TypeScript

## Task

Develop a backend server with ExpressJS. You are required to build a set of CRUD interface that allow a user to interact with the service. You are required to use TypeScript for this task.

1. Interface functionalities:
    1. Create a resource.
    2. List resources with basic filters.
    3. Get details of a resource.
    4. Update resource details.
    5. Delete a resource.
2. You should connect your backend service with a simple database for data persistence.
3. Provide [`README.md`](http://README.md) for the configuration and the way to run application.

## My Thinking

The requirements are create a CRUD API with Express.js and TypeScript.

> But i don't know if i can use a powerful framework like NestJS, so i will use the basic Express.js.
> 
> Because i don't have much time, i will make the API by NestJS + ORM first. If i have time, i will make the API by basic Express.js.

## Technologies

I choose the following technologies:

- TypeScript
- NestJS use Express.js
- MySQL for database
- TypeORM for ORM
- Swagger for API documentation
- Docker & Docker Compose for containerization
- WebStorm for IDE

## Solution

The source code is in `nest-crud` directory. Please follow the instructions in the `README.md` file to run the application.

## Conclusion

I have implemented the CRUD API with NestJS. The project structure is well-organized and the code is clean and easy to understand.
